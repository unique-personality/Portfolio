Personal Portfolio Website

‚ú® Welcome to my digital canvas ‚ú® 

This repository houses my professional portfolio website‚Äîa sleek, interactive showcase of my journey as a developer. Meticulously crafted with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates my commitment to clean code and fundamental web technologies.


üíª Tech Stack
This portfolio was intentionally built using only core web technologies:

HTML5 - Semantic structure providing a solid foundation

CSS3 - Custom animations, flexbox/grid layouts, and media queries

JavaScript - Vanilla JS for interactive elements and smooth user experience

No frameworks, no libraries‚Äîjust pure code that showcases my fundamental understanding of web development principles.

üîç Behind the Design
Every pixel and interaction has been thoughtfully considered. The design philosophy balances professional aesthetics with personality, creating a memorable experience that reflects both my technical abilities and creative vision.

Feel free to explore the code that powers my digital presence. This portfolio represents not just what I've built, but how I build‚Äîwith attention to detail, clean architecture, and a passion for exceptional user experience.
